CHANGELOG
=========

v0.3
	- Renamed project, improved grammar/wording of script output and comments
	- Added Arch Linux PKGBUILD script
	- Added (many) and renamed config file options, changed config file path to a less cluttery location
	- Made config file global for all helix scripts
	- Streamlined scripts and organised them better (especially removed tons of crufty text)
	- Changed default behaviour of helix-rotate to cycle through all rotations
	- Updated manpage
	- Removed input method autolaunch for now
	- Removed kdialog popups because we're not all on KDE
	- Removed helix-rotate-left shortcut
	- Relicensed under WTFPL (the original remains GPL)

v0.1 (the release i forked, termed 1.0 but far from 1.0 completeness)
	- Forked from Marin Ueding's think-rotate project on github
	- Implemented helix-rotate script (a version of think-rotate, 
	  but specialized to the ThinkPad Helix)
	- Documented a tentative fix to the loss of ButtonDown 
	  events through touchscreen.
